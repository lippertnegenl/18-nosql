I thought this assingmnet was interesting because we got to setup models and routes and create an app that was interactive with the user.  Up until now the ability of the user to enter data or change the info on the app has been limited.  On this app the user can add thoughts and delete thoughts as well as actions.  They can add or remove friends or create new users.  This assignment layout seemed similar to how 13 but uses alot of new stuff.  Unfortunatley I had some of the same problems with my routes and had trouble demonstrating its abilities in insomnia.
